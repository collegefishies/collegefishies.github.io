			"content": <>I was watching a video game, where this guy had this term "Immersive UI" where the UI would only appear when you needed it. When you moused over near the item. It allowed for an immersive view of the content that really allowed one to focus and enjoy the scene. <br/><br/>I was really excited to see that, as it seems almost all UI's avoid that principle. There's this design principle that it breaks which is Nielsen's "Visibility of System Status. The problem with this design principle, is inevitably the user will become accustomed to a user interface, if the app is meant to be used in the long term for a long time. Think Coursera, Netflix or a Goodnotes. However, only one of these embraces this "Immersive UI" by allowing the UI to disappear, and that's Netflix when the movie is playing. Coursera, and Goodnotes, and Safari all waste a massive amount of screen real estate on elements that do not need to be there most of the time. <br/><br/> I think we need to embrace more immersive UI's that make it easier to study, relax, and take notes, and otherwise do work. I'm glad I'm learning Front End Development. It allows me to make apps to actively engage in making such decisions reality. </>

			"content": <div>I made my first wireframe! It's a design tool for rapid prototyping of interfaces. Such wireframes focus only on the structure of the content, not the aesthetics and finer details. Hence, the lack of images. <br/><br/> First step was to note the requirements for the page. Those are on the left. Then on the frame the sizing for each of the blocks is laid out, and represented with colored blocks and labeled. Afterwards, they are shrunk in width and moved to the side as a reference. This marks the completion of the rough design. <br/> <br/> The design is refined by adding the components that then populate the required blocks with placeholder images and icon, and some sample text.</div>

They mentioned a really fascinating idea in one of the readings. Essentially, forms are gatekeepers. They stand between the user and their goal. Like in Netflix, they're the gatekeeper between the user and watching movies... That really makes them of absolutely fundamental importance. What if you could really reduce that friction. And make them less like gatekeepers and more like checkpoints. Effortless to go through."

			"content": "So much to do! I just finished the advanced react course which is a nice resting point. There's actually too much so I want to write down the options. One, I have a coding interview at a very interesting company lined up so that means possibly studying Algorithms and Data Structures. That means LeetCode and possibly the Coursera course on that topic. Another thing is I have another interview with another company that is on SQL and RESTful APIs so that would mean studying those two components. Which I could definitely do in two weeks. SQL itself is interesting because thats database management. Managing massive amounts of data. While this blog isn't there yet, it's easy to imagine how it could get quite large and unmanageable. I also have this business idea, which involves building an iOS app. So that would mean continuing learning about UX/UI in both the Meta Front End and Meta iOS Developer coures. (They overlap so its only one course!) It doesn't seem the most interesting thing to me right now, but I do want to build the app. I guess I did a lot of work today on the blog, so I'll just take a break and come back to it later :) Oh yeah, I also have to add my various non-coding projects to this website."

			"content": "I just completed the course on Advanced React Components! We reviewed components. Programmatic usage of data with mapping lists to components, as well as keys and their importance in informing react of node updates in lists. We also covered forms and react: controlled vs. uncontrolled components, as well as how to make controlled components. We learned about context via React's Context API to prevent prop drilling. We covered the hooks useState, useRef, useEffect for side-effects. Also, building custom hooks was covered as well as the rules of hooks. Furthermore, we learned about useReducer hooks when more complicated state changes needed to be taken into account rather than the simpler functionality afforded by useState. Higher-Order Components (HOCs) to extend functionality and help deal with cross-cutting concerns as well as the concept of currying. As well as the render props technique for implementing the same behaviour as HOCs. We also practiced testing of react components using jest and the React testing library for testing components for continuous integration.",

				<p>Today I received my Quest 3, and ran a simple 3D Scene with physics on the quest headset! For the past few days, I've been studying Unity. (I tried Unreal Engine but unfortunately the Oculus + Unreal fork does not have Mac support). I've had a lot of ideas in the Software, and AR/VR space, but no skills to make them real. Today I've taking a real demonstrable step towards changing that. I ran my own app in the Quest 3! Not only that Unity had an error with finding the Android NDK, and I fixed that bug. Of course, ChatGPT made it painless by giving me things to check step by step. Luckily the first thing was the solution. Man, I wish ChatGPT existed at the start of my PhD instead of the end.</p>

Of reproducing a design element (in react) from design, demonstrating aptitude in HTML/CSS/React and JavaScript! See my <b>Age Calculator</b> <Link to="/samples">here</Link>. What's absolutely wonderful about React is it makes it really easy to combine components. Adding this calculator to my old pure HTML website would have been a headache.</p>

It was a vector calculus library that made simulation of N 3D particles simple, so I needed to use it a lot. But also, I would discover add functionality I could add later. So I needed some way to be able to use the most up to date function and also a way to update all copies simultaneously.  I don't remember how I found out about it, but that's exactly what hard links are. They are pointers to the same file in storage. So opening and editing it is editing the same file. It gives non-local access in a way that looks local to anyone using the hard link.</p>,

				<p>I learned about linters in the context of HTML/CSS. The essentially just check for syntax errors. Since CSS provides absolutely no runtime halts when running code this makes them necessary for CSS debugging. I just added an HTML one because I was curious how good my source was. So I installed SublimeLinter. It was surprisingly annoying. For future use, the steps are: 1. Install SublimeLinter 2. Install SublimeLinter extensions for each linter, e.g., stylelint and html tidy 3. Configure the package settings for Sublime Linter to notify it of your new linters. Without this step, they will not function.</p>

However, what I've realized in both building this website, is I can see how pure HTML can lead to a very long file that will become harder to manage over time. So I'm interested in learning React to handle retaining components and managing the layout programmatically. This especially makes sense for blog posts, as they'll all have the same format and simply grow in number, so a database is a better place to store them rather than in the HTML.",

					I've been taking a Front-end dev course on Coursera from Meta, and while I am learning. I am not mastering. I have a better top down understanding of the field of web dev, but to really get my hands dirty, I need something to make. <br /><br />Unfortunately, since web-dev isn't just programming, it is programming with design, I need designs to copy off of. So I think a great route to get practice is to find websites to copy, and without looking at their source, try and reproduce their designs. I wonder if there is a website that does this with proceedingly difficult website layouts.
